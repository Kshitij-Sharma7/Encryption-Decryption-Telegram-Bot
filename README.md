## üîê Encryption-Decryption Telegram Bot ü§ñ

---
<br/>

### About the project:
- A Telegram bot that encrypts and decrypts plain text messages using python which can then be safely sent across any network.

- This bot encrypts and decrypts messages using the [one-time-pad(OTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) logic.

- To get started, launch the [bot](https://t.me/Encr_decr_bot).

  - It will look something like this:

  ![Start screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kshitij-Sharma7/Encryption-Decryption-Telegram-Bot/master/res/Start.jpg "Start screen")
  
  <br>

  - Entering a plain text will give an encryped message for the same:
  <br>
  ![Encrypt screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kshitij-Sharma7/Encryption-Decryption-Telegram-Bot/master/res/Encrypt.jpg "Encrypt screen")

  <br>

  - Forwarding or copy/pasting the encrypted message and giving it to the bot gives back the original message:
  <br>
  ![Decrypt screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kshitij-Sharma7/Encryption-Decryption-Telegram-Bot/master/res/Decrypt.jpg "Decrypt screen")
  Congratulations! You were successful in encrypting and decrypting a message!
  
  <br>

  - The bot also replies to some commands like /greet and /hello:

  <br>

  - Note that the bot supports only plain text, so if a document/audio/photo/sticker is given to it, it responds by saying:
  <br>
